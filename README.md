# My-Project
This repository works as a backup for my master thesis codes and documents.

In the temp brach, I push new documents before merging them to main.

Directories:

MCMC fit results: contains the results of my longest MCMCs

Presentation: Contains materials from my presentations

every day update: contains the latest version of my codes for convenience
